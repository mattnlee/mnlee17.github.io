I was a hater of God and of His word, living in darkness as a self-deceived enemy of Christ. I knew that I was a sinner in need of God’s grace, but was never interested in committing my life to Christ. I thought it sounded so burdensome to obey Christ and have my sins forgiven. I didn’t want to learn from God’s word because I had a desire for other things that I thought were better than reading a boring book of things I already knew. I believed that all my happiness stemmed from the sins that I committed. I thought that if they would be taken away from me, all my enjoyment in life would be forfeited. I did not understand what burden of sin and shame I was actually bearing, and was blinded to the real joy of turning away from sin. So instead of repenting from my sins and being reconciled to God, I chose to reject God and ignore Him altogether. I pursued every wicked deed that my heart desired, and secretly disobeyed my parents. This is how I was living before coming to Christ.<!-- --> </p><p>Then, in 2023, God put an end to my dirty life of sin. He miraculously opened my eyes to see my wretchedness, and I came to understand just how sinful I was. I didn’t want to live in the sins that I had been living in for so long. I had a new desire to be washed clean of all my sins, and be righted with God. I asked God to grant me forgiveness for all the wicked things I had committed against Him. By His grace, He heard my prayers, and began to work salvation in my heart. Since that time, I have lived a life of turning away from sin and listening to His truth. I daily read God’s word to be “transformed in the renewing of the mind” (Rom. 12:2). I have come to understand that there is a spiritual force that fights against Christ’s people to try to lead them astray from the truth. So, in order that I might be equipped with Christ’s strength to resist temptations, I daily strive to set my mind on “the things above, where Christ is, seated at the hand of God” (Col. 3:1). I have many nagging weaknesses which I find to be very frustrating to deal with. Yet God, in His mercy, helps my weaknesses, always providing me with the pathway to change. He sees how I struggle with my sin, and continues to lead me on the path of righteousness, that I would produce the fruits of repentance. All in all, I have been saved by the grace of God through Christ’s substitutionary death on my behalf. I am now a new creature, growing as a disciple of Christ, and awaiting the second coming of my Lord.</p></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/faith","query":{},"buildId":"UPxim9XPcV_9Mdb1z-eu9","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
