      <h1>FAITH</h1>
      <p>
        There was a time in my life when I lived for my own self-pleasure and
        enjoyment. I was a hater of God and of His word, living in darkness as a
        self-deceived enemy of Christ. I knew that I was a sinner in need of
        God’s grace, but was never interested in committing my life to Christ. I
        thought it sounded so burdensome to obey Christ and have my sins
        forgiven. I didn’t want to learn from God’s word because I had a desire
        for other things that I thought were better than reading a boring book
        of things I already knew. I believed that all my happiness stemmed from
        the sins that I committed. I thought that if they would be taken away
        from me, all my enjoyment in life would be forfeited. I did not
        understand what burden of sin and shame I was actually bearing, and was
        blinded to the real joy of turning away from sin. So instead of
        repenting from my sins and being reconciled to God, I chose to reject
        God and ignore Him altogether. I pursued every wicked deed that my heart
        desired, and secretly disobeyed my parents. This is how I was living
        before coming to Christ.{" "}

        Then, in 2023, God put an end to my dirty life of sin. He miraculously
        opened my eyes to see my wretchedness, and I came to understand just how
        sinful I was. I didn’t want to live in the sins that I had been living
        in for so long. I had a new desire to be washed clean of all my sins,
        and be righted with God. I asked God to grant me forgiveness for all the
        wicked things I had committed against Him. By His grace, He heard my
        prayers, and began to work salvation in my heart. Since that time, I
        have lived a life of turning away from sin and listening to His truth. I
        daily read God’s word to be “transformed in the renewing of the mind”
        (Rom. 12:2). I have come to understand that there is a spiritual force
        that fights against Christ’s people to try to lead them astray from the
        truth. So, in order that I might be equipped with Christ’s strength to
        resist temptations, I daily strive to set my mind on “the things above,
        where Christ is, seated at the hand of God” (Col. 3:1). I have many
        nagging weaknesses which I find to be very frustrating to deal with. Yet
        God, in His mercy, helps my weaknesses, always providing me with the
        pathway to change. He sees how I struggle with my sin, and continues to
        lead me on the path of righteousness, that I would produce the fruits of
        repentance. All in all, I have been saved by the grace of God through
        Christ’s substitutionary death on my behalf. I am now a new creature,
        growing as a disciple of Christ, and awaiting the second coming of my
        Lord.
